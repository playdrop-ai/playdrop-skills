# Playdrop

This is the legacy compatibility skill package generated from the canonical `playdrop-plugin` repo.

- Canonical source: `https://github.com/playdrop-ai/playdrop-plugin`
- Legacy compatibility surface: `https://github.com/playdrop-ai/playdrop-skills`
- Synced platform version: `0.7.0`
- Preferred public setup: install the `playdrop-plugin` repo for Codex, Claude Code, or Cursor and use its specialist skills

Use this skill only when you are in a legacy skill-first environment and do not have the plugin available.

## First steps

1. Preferred public setup: install the `playdrop-plugin` repo in your AI tool and start with `task-routing` if you are unsure which specialist skill to use
2. Install the CLI: `npm install -g @playdrop/playdrop-cli`
3. Log in: `playdrop auth login`
4. Initialize: existing project -> `playdrop project init .` ; new project -> `playdrop project create app <name> --template <ref>`
5. Validate: `playdrop project validate .`

## Use this skill when

- your AI tool only supports the old skill install model
- you need the legacy `skills.sh` compatibility surface
- you need to plan a new Playdrop game
- you need to cut scope before implementation
- you need gameplay mockups or a candid gameplay review
- you want to inspect references, assets, or starter kits
- you need help improving an existing game before publish
- you need store listing guidance
- you want to integrate services like auth, saves, realtime, monetization, or AI assets
- you need the legacy broad Playdrop workflow rather than a more specific skill

## Recommended specialist skills

If the environment supports the plugin or more specific generated skills from the same legacy repo, prefer the focused workflow instead of keeping everything in this umbrella skill:

- `game-planning`
- `scope-control`
- `gameplay-mockups`
- `asset-discovery`
- `project-updates`
- `dev-testing`
- `game-improvement`
- `gameplay-review`
- `store-listing`
- `comment-monitoring`
- `game-marketing`
- `service-integration`
- `engine-porting`
- `creator-support`

## Shared references

Use the local `references/` files in this legacy package when you need more detail:

- `cli-map.md`
- `discovery.md`
- `pitch-and-validation.md`
- `scope-cutting.md`
- `gameplay-mockups.md`
- `gameplay-review.md`
- `existing-projects.md`
- `create-and-remix.md`
- `godot-porting.md`
- `racing.md`
- `platformer-3d.md`
- `fps.md`
- `services.md`
- `assets-and-generation.md`
- `audio.md`
- `publish-and-listing.md`
- `live-ops.md`
- `performance-debugging.md`

## Rules

- prefer the public plugin when it is available
- prefer public Playdrop docs and stable CLI commands
- use `playdrop documentation browse` and `playdrop documentation read <path>` when you need the latest product guidance
- keep guidance focused on public creator workflows
- if a more specific generated skill is installed, hand off to it rather than keeping everything in this umbrella flow
